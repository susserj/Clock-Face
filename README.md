The purpose of this repository is to allow readers of my book 

Heirloom Project,
Traditional Mission Style Wall Clock

To be able to freely download my clockface design rather than re-creatining
if completely from scratch.

My clock face design was created with LibreDraw version 25.8.5.2(x86) 
which is part of the LibreOffice Suite. If you want to print or modify 
this design you will need this software.

You are free to modify my design to meet your own individual requirements.
However, if you publish your deriviative of my design please give me credit.
